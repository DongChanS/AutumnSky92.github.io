## What it means to be AI first

### What it means to be Artificial Intelligence first

#### What is the difference between AI and ML?
- AI는 일종의 물리학의 한 분야 > 인간처럼 생각하고, 행동하는 기계를 만드는 이론과 방법에 관련됨
- ML은 도구 모음(Toolset) > ML(도구)를 통해 특정 종류 AI의 문제점을 해결 가능

## Two stages of ML
- Training & Inference
- stage 1: Train an ML model with examples / ML relies on labeled examples
- stage 2: Predict with a trained model / Predict on new data > Models generalize about new data > Data is the fuel for ML models

## ML in Google products
- Neural networks are one important technology we use
- One Solution may have many ML models
    - Predict Product Demand
    - Predict Inventory
    - Many ML models per product
